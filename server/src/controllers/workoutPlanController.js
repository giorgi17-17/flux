-  number of exercises for each day must be minimum 15 and maximum 20.
- You must return array of ${numberOfWeeks} weeks.
- return only array do not write any text .
- dont put array into quotes.
- you must return days array where you include workout days and rest days 
if it is rest day mark it as true.
- create workouts based on ${workouts}. 
- You must not create full body workout in targeted_body_part if it is not included in ${workouts}.  
- reps and duration corelation if reps has number make duration null and if duration has number in seconds make reps null but both of them needs to be in the object
